# Kling MCP input and output contract

This reference records only stable tool-level constraints. Always take models, defaults, enums, required fields, item limits, and media inputs from the current `tools/list` and `who_am_i` response.

## Tool groups

- Discovery and account: `who_am_i`, `query_membership_and_credits`, `logout`
- Generation and status: `text_to_image`, `image_to_image`, `text_to_video`, `image_to_video`, `omni_ref_video`, `motion_control`, `query_tasks`
- Media and reuse: `file_upload`, `motion_library_list`, `element_create`, `element_list`, `element_get`, `element_update`, `element_delete`

Call only tools that exist in the current tool list.

## Generation request

- Generation tools normally use `model`, `arguments[]`, `inputs[]`, `rationale`, and `taskTraceId`; the live tool `inputSchema` defines the actual outer request and encoding. Omit unused inputs when allowed, but never omit required media.
- Always send a top-level `model` using the exact canonical ID returned by `who_am_i` for the selected tool, even if the tool schema omits it from `required`. Missing, null, empty, or whitespace-only values are invalid. A model name in the prompt does not fill this field.
- Each `arguments[]` item is `{name, value}`. Supply each required argument once, including `prompt` when required. Use an empty prompt only if the model allows it and it matches the user's intent. Encode values as strings when the schema requires it. Use the selected model's resolution field, enum, and conditions.
- Each `inputs[]` item is `{name, inputType, url}`. Bind every slot the selected mode requires, such as `image_1` when declared. Use the exact schema literal for `inputType`, including uppercase `URL` when declared. Use the complete reference from a [successful upload](asset-workflows.md#local-media-uploads). Omit `inputs` only when there are no media inputs and the schema permits it.
- `rationale` explains the user's objective and parameter choices. It does not replace the generation prompt.
- `taskTraceId` is a UUIDv7. Reuse it for one objective and create a fresh value for an unrelated objective.

Follow [capability discovery](capability-discovery.md) before submission and reuse its successful response for the same preparation unless invalidated. Model capabilities come from `who_am_i`, while request structure comes from the tool `inputSchema`; general descriptions do not expand model capabilities. Refresh inconsistent definitions and stop if no valid request satisfies both. Apply the selected model's [parameter and combination constraints](model-parameters.md).

## Stable gates

- Element support is model-specific, not determined by an entry point's name. Do not pass an Element or prompt binding unless the selected model explicitly declares the binding argument and support for that resource type.
- Call `element_get` before using an Element. Check `elementSupport`, required media, individual and combined caps, and reference-video conditions for the selected model, including omni reference.
- `motion_control` requires a subject image. Follow the tool description when choosing exactly one motion source: a library `motionId` or a source video.
- When a model requires media from `file_upload`, do not pass a local path or arbitrary external URL directly.
- Never pass an undeclared argument, input name, or enum value.

## Elements

- An image Element uses a cover and the provider-allowed number of secondary images. Do not combine it with a video resource.
- A video Element uses a video resource and may include voice only when the tool allows it. Do not combine it with cover or secondary images.
- Use only tags declared by the tool description.
- Call `element_get` before `element_update`, then update the complete object so omitted fields are not cleared accidentally.
- Obtain explicit user confirmation before deletion or a delete-and-recreate workflow.

## Known results

- A generation submission normally returns `generationId` and `status`, and may return `creditsConsumed`.
- `query_tasks` normally returns task status, timestamps, and `works[]`. A work may include primary media, unwatermarked media, and cover URLs. Determine terminal state and media semantics from the live response.
- Signed URLs may expire. Never log them or treat them as permanent asset identifiers.
- For a tool without a public output schema, use the real response as returned. Do not invent fields or success states.
